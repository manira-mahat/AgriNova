1. Introduction 
Agriculture in Nepal is still largely guided by traditional practices, where farmers rely on 
experience and local knowledge to make decisions about what crops to plant, how much 
fertilizer to apply, and when to harvest. While this approach has been passed down through 
generations, it often leads to unpredictable outcomes such as poor yields, crop failures, and 
financial instability. Rapidly changing weather conditions, limited access to scientific 
guidance, and fluctuating market prices make farming even more uncertain, leaving many 
farmers vulnerable to risk. 
To address these challenges, AgriNova has been developed as a mobile-based digital 
advisory system that helps farmers make informed, data-driven decisions. The system is 
designed to be simple and farmer-friendly, ensuring that even those with limited technical 
knowledge can benefit from it. Farmers can enter details about their soil, such as pH levels, 
nutrient content (NPK), rainfall, and district. Based on this input, AgriNova generates 
personalized recommendations for suitable crops and stores the results for future reference. 
The platform also provides basic information about crop requirements, allowing farmers to 
plan their cultivation practices more efficiently. 
The strength of AgriNova lies in its use of the Decision Tree algorithm, which analyzes 
soil conditions and rainfall data to recommend the most suitable crops for cultivation. The 
algorithm evaluates parameters such as soil pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and 
rainfall to classify the input data and predict the best crop option. This scientific approach 
ensures that farmers make decisions based on objective data rather than guesswork or 
tradition. Additionally, the system incorporates a Nearest Market Finder module, which 
helps farmers identify and locate the closest agricultural markets to sell their produce 
efficiently. By combining intelligent crop recommendation with accessible market 
information in a single mobile platform, AgriNova empowers farmers with reliable 
guidance, reduces risks, and promotes more productive and sustainable farming practices 
across Nepal across Nepal.

Problem Statement 
Managing agriculture in Nepal through traditional practices presents several challenges for 
farmers. Crop selection is often based on guesswork or local tradition rather than scientific 
data, which can lead to poor yield or crop failure. Fertilizer application is frequently 
imbalanced, either excessive or insufficient, resulting in soil degradation and reduced 
productivity. Farmers also struggle to plan farming activities due to unpredictable weather, 
relying on outdated information or informal sources that may not be reliable. 
Farmers often lack access to proper agricultural guidance and modern decision-support 
systems that could help them choose suitable crops based on their specific soil and 
environmental conditions. As a result, farming outcomes remain uncertain, and the 
potential for higher productivity is not fully realized. Additionally, the absence of a 
centralized system to store and analyze soil data limits the ability to make consistent, data
driven decisions in future farming cycles. 
These challenges highlight the urgent need for a systematic, digital, and data-driven 
advisory tool that can assist farmers with crop planning and selection. Such a system, like 
AgriNova, can use soil parameters such as pH level, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and 
rainfall to recommend the most suitable crop for cultivation. By providing scientific and 
data-based insights, this solution will help improve agricultural productivity, enhance 
sustainability, and empower farmers to make informed decisions that reduce risks and 
improve yields. 
Objectives 
The objectives are: 
 To provide farmers with personalized crop recommendations. 
 To help farmers make data-driven agricultural decisions based on soil and rainfall 
data. 
 To help farmers find the nearest markets to sell their produce. 
2. Methodology 
a) Requirement Identification

i. 
Study of Existing System 
Several digital agriculture platforms and advisory systems have been developed to support 
farmers by providing information and recommendations. However, most existing systems 
focus on specific areas rather than offering complete, data-driven solutions. A brief 
overview of some well-known platforms is as follows: 
 Plantix: A mobile app that provides pest and disease detection through image 
recognition. While useful, it lacks market price prediction and localized crop 
recommendations. 
 Krishi Guru: Provides general agricultural knowledge in Nepal but does not integrate 
intelligent algorithms for personalized recommendations. 
 AgriApp: Offers weather updates, crop practices, and Agri-input information but has 
limited decision-making features and is not tailored for Nepali farmers. 
Identified Gaps: 
While these platforms assist farmers in various aspects, they generally do not address the 
following limitations: 
 Absence of data-driven crop recommendation systems based on soil properties and 
rainfall data. 
 Limited implementation of intelligent algorithms such as Decision Tree for 
decision-making. 
These limitations highlight the need for a customized and data-driven digital advisory 
system such as AgriNova, which uses the Decision Tree algorithm to provide accurate and 
scientific crop recommendations. By focusing on simplicity, reliability, and practical 
application, AgriNova aims to assist farmers in making informed, data-supported decisions 
to enhance productivity and promote sustainable farming practices. 
ii. 
Literature Review 
Decision tree methods have been widely adopted for classification tasks in many domains 
due to their interpretability and ease of implementation. Quinlan’s seminal work on 
induction of decision trees established practical algorithms for generating trees from 
labeled data, enabling clear rule-based decisions and fast inference [1]. For AgriNova, 
Decision Trees provide a transparent way to recommend crops: trained on soil and climatic 
attributes, a tree can map combinations of pH, NPK levels, rainfall and season into 
actionable crop choices that farmers can understand and trust.

Clustering techniques, in particular the K-Means algorithm introduced by MacQueen, are 
foundational for grouping similar multivariate observations efficiently [2]. K-Means is well 
suited to partition soil nutrient profiles (N, P, K) into clusters indicating types of nutrient 
deficiency or balance. In AgriNova, applying K-Means to soil test results enables the 
system to recommend fertilizer types and dosages by matching a farmer’s soil profile to the 
nearest cluster prototype and its associated corrective action. 
Regression analysis offers straightforward and statistically grounded methods for 
forecasting continuous variables. Draper and Smith’s presentation of applied regression 
techniques highlights model fitting, diagnostics, and prediction—practical tools for short
term forecasting tasks [3]. For weather forecasting in AgriNova, linear regression (or 
multivariate linear models) can provide efficient, interpretable short-horizon estimates of 
temperature or rainfall when trained on local historical observations and recent API
provided data. 
Time-series smoothing and forecasting methods, such as the moving average and the Box
Jenkins family of models, are effective for detecting trends and short-term patterns in noisy 
data [4]. The moving average technique can smooth daily market prices to reveal the 
underlying trend and reduce volatility, which is exactly what AgriNova requires to present 
farmers with clearer short-term price expectations and to signal likely price rises or falls. 
Graph algorithms are central to routing and network problems. Dijkstra’s shortest path 
algorithm remains a standard, provably optimal method to compute minimum-cost routes 
on weighted graphs [5]. In AgriNova, modeling roads and market locations as a weighted 
graph (weights = distance/time/cost) allows Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute the most 
efficient route from a farmer’s village to the nearest or best market, improving logistics and 
reducing transport costs. 
Instance-based classification, exemplified by the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) rule described 
by Cover and Hart, is useful when labeled examples exist and model interpretability is 
important [6]. KNN’s simplicity and effectiveness for image-based tasks make it a 
reasonable choice for an initial pest/disease detection module in AgriNova: by extracting 
features from leaf images and comparing them to a labeled dataset, the system can classify 
likely diseases and suggest treatments, with the option to replace or augment KNN with 
more advanced CNN models later.

Requirement Analysis 
For AgriNova to function effectively and provide reliable, user-friendly support to farmers, 
it must address both functional and non-functional requirements. These requirements 
ensure that the system not only delivers accurate crop and market recommendations but 
also remains secure, scalable, and easy to use in real-world farming conditions. 
Functional Requirements: 
 User Authentication: Farmers should be able to register, log in securely, and 
manage their personal profiles. 
 Crop Recommendation: The system must provide crop suggestions based on soil 
details (pH, NPK values), rainfall using Decision Tree algorithms. 
 Nearest Market Finder: The system will identify and display the nearest available 
markets based on the farmer’s district or provided location. The feature will use 
basic geolocation data and distance calculations to suggest the most accessible 
selling points for agricultural produce. 
 Crud Operations:  Administrators should have access to add, update, view, and 
delete crop datasets. Farmers should be able to input their soil data and view past 
recommendations. 
 Data Storage: The system should store all user information, soil data, and 
recommendation results in a MySQL database for future reference. 
 Mobile Accessibility: The application must be available as a mobile app built using 
Flutter, providing a smooth and intuitive user experience . 
Non-Functional Requirements: 
 Security: All user data and crop information must be securely stored and protected 
from unauthorized access. 
 Performance: Recommendations should be generated quickly, ideally within two 
seconds of user input. 
 Usability: The interface must be simple, clear, and easy to navigate for users with 
limited technical experience. 
 Scalability: The system should support the future addition of new crops, 
parameters, or analytical features as data availability increases. 
 Reliability: The algorithm’s recommendations should be consistent and accurate, 
and the system should maintain stable performance during use.

b) Feasibility Study 
i. 
Technical Feasibility 
The proposed system will utilize Flutter for developing a cross-platform mobile application 
that runs smoothly. The backend services will be developed using Python (Django 
framework), which will handle user authentication, data processing, communication with 
the database, and execution of the Decision Tree algorithm. The MySQL database will be 
used as the main data storage system to manage user details, soil inputs, crop 
recommendations, and market data due to its high reliability, scalability, and ease of 
integration with Django. 
Since Flutter, Django, and MySQL are all open-source, stable, and well-documented 
technologies, the development and deployment of the AgriNova system are technically 
feasible. These technologies ensure smooth integration, easy maintenance, and low 
development cost, making the project suitable for an individual student implementation 
while maintaining strong performance and professional functionality. 
ii. 
Operational Feasibility 
The system is designed to be simple and user-friendly, allowing both farmers and 
administrators to use the application without technical expertise. The interface will enable 
farmers to easily input soil parameters and receive instant crop recommendations generated 
by the Decision Tree algorithm. Additionally, the system will include a Nearest Market 
Finder feature that allows farmers to locate the closest agricultural markets based on their 
district or entered location. Administrators can efficiently manage crop and market datasets 
through built-in CRUD operations. The straightforward design ensures smooth operation, 
easy adoption, and minimal need for training or external support. 
iii. 
Economic Feasibility 
The development of AgriNova remains cost-effective as it uses only open-source 
technologies such as Flutter, Django, and MySQL, which do not require expensive licenses. 
The system can operate on standard mobile devices with minimal server requirements, 
making it affordable to deploy and maintain. Since the project architecture supports 
scalability, new modules such as market data or additional crop information can be added 
in the future at a low cost. This ensures that the system remains sustainable, economical, 
and beneficial for long-term use in the agricultural sector.

iterative development, continuous feedback, and flexibility. The project will be divided into 
key modules such as user authentication, crop recommendation using the Decision Tree 
algorithm, nearest market finder, and CRUD operations for managing crop and market data. 
Each module will be designed, implemented, and tested in short development cycles to 
ensure accuracy, usability, and smooth performance. This iterative approach allows for 
quick updates, incorporation of user feedback, and easy integration of new features, 
ensuring that AgriNova remains efficient, user-friendly, and adaptable for future 
enhancements.

Working Mechanism 
Frontend Design: The AgriNova mobile application will be developed using Flutter. The 
interface will be clean, intuitive, and user-friendly, allowing farmers to register, log in, 
input soil parameters such as pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and rainfall, and view 
crop recommendations generated by the system. Additionally, the application will include 
a Nearest Market Finder feature that lets farmers view nearby agricultural markets based 
on their district or entered location. The advisory dashboard will present crop 
recommendations and market results in a clear and accessible format. 
Backend Development: The backend will be developed using Python (Django 
framework), which will handle all server-side logic and communication between the mobile 
app and the database. It will process farmer inputs and execute the Decision Tree algorithm 
to determine the most suitable crop based on soil and rainfall data. The backend will also 
manage Nearest Market Finder operations, which calculate and display the closest 
agricultural markets based on the farmer’s district or entered location. In addition, Django 
will handle user authentication, data validation, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
operations for both crop and market datasets. Its robust architecture ensures secure data 
8 
handling, efficient communication with Flutter, and seamless integration with the MySQL 
database. 
Database Design: A MySQL database will store structured data such as user details, soil 
inputs, crop datasets, market information, and crop recommendation results. The database 
will support fast querying, secure data storage, and reliable access for both farmers and 
administrators. It will also ensure efficient management of crop and market records, 
enabling accurate recommendations and easy retrieval of nearby market details for farmers. 
iv. 
Algorithms 
The AgriNova uses two algorithms to assist farmers in making informed agricultural 
decisions — the Decision Tree algorithm for personalized crop recommendations and the 
Haversine formula for finding the nearest agricultural market. Together, these algorithms 
help farmers choose the best crops for their soil conditions and locate nearby markets to 
sell their produce efficiently. 
a) Decision Tree 
The Decision Tree algorithm is used to recommend the most suitable crop based on soil 
conditions, rainfall, and season. It works by dividing the input data into decision points 
(e.g., soil pH, rainfall level) and reaching the best possible crop at the end of the path. 
Working Mechanism: 
 Collect soil features such as pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and rainfall. 
 Compare these values against thresholds at each decision node. 
 Reach the leaf node that suggests the best crop for the farmer. 
Mathematical Formulation: 
 Entropy (impurity measure): 
�
�
 𝐇(𝐒) = −∑𝑝𝑖𝐥𝐨𝐠𝟐𝑝𝑖
 𝒊=𝟏
  Information Gain (to select the best split): 
�
�𝐆(𝐒,𝐀) = 𝐇(𝐒)− ∑ |𝑺𝑽|
 𝒗∈𝑽𝒂𝒍𝒖𝒆𝒔(𝑨)
 |𝑺|
 𝑯(𝑺𝑽)
 9 
b) Haversine Formula (Nearest Market Finder) 
The Haversine formula is used to calculate the distance between the farmer’s location and 
different market locations using their latitude and longitude coordinates. This helps 
identify the nearest market for selling agricultural produce efficiently. 
Working Mechanism: 
 The farmer inputs their district or location. 
 The system retrieves the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of all available 
markets from the database. 
 The Haversine formula is applied to calculate the great-circle distance between the 
farmer and each market. 
 The system displays the market with the shortest distance as the nearest one. 
Mathematical Formulation:
