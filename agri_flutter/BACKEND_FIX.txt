STEPS TO FIX CONNECTION ISSUE
==============================

Your Flutter app has been updated to connect to: http://192.168.18.195:8000/api/

Now follow these steps for your Django backend:

1. STOP your current Django server (Ctrl+C)

2. GO TO your Django project folder (wherever manage.py is located)

3. OPEN settings.py and find ALLOWED_HOSTS, update it to:
   ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1', 'localhost', '192.168.18.195', '*']

4. START Django server with:
   python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

5. VERIFY it's running by visiting in browser:
   http://192.168.18.195:8000/api/

6. In your Flutter app terminal, press 'R' to hot restart (or stop and restart the app)

IMPORTANT:
- Make sure your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network
- The IP address 192.168.18.195 is your computer's current IP
- If your computer's IP changes, update the baseUrl in lib/services/api_service.dart

TESTING:
After following these steps, try registering again in your app.
